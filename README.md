Food Delivery Analysis Project

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, food delivery services have become an essential part of daily life. With the rise of online ordering platforms, understanding consumer preferences and optimizing delivery processes is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and boost operational efficiency.

This project focuses on analyzing food delivery data to uncover patterns and insights that can drive strategic decision-making. By employing Power BI, we create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators and trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed choices based on real-time data.

Through this analysis, we explore various aspects of food delivery, including peak order times, customer segmentation, delivery performance, and geographic trends. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help improve service quality, increase customer engagement, and ultimately, drive business growth.

This Project is made by Akshat Agrawal and Om Sonwane for DANLC sprint 1 project.
